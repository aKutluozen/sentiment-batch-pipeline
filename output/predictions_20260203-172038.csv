The performance it delivers is just unmatched. On practical usage, it can easily beat the high-end Windows laptops. You are gonna love it from the moment you unbox it and would kinda wanna eat it once it falls in your hands.

The Apple silicon laptops really over-deliver than their on-paper specs. If it fits your budget...

"Been waiting to buy a macbook since M1 lunch, but finally bought Air M2 because of BBD in Flipkart. I got it at an unbelievable price. But I was a little disappointed with the delivery as it got delivered after 4 days after it came out for delivery.

I think I don't need to talk anything about Macbook Air M2 performance, it's literally awesome and no window laptop can beat it's battery.",NEGATIVE,0.9795873165130615,

"Apple Macbook Air M2 is my first laptop and I don't even need to elaborate on the quality and user friendliness of Apple devices. They always set the bar high when it comes to attention to detail like multiple device integration in the Apple ecosystem. No other company till now has been able to accomplish this feat so efficiently. Everything is so seamless that we are in awe of Apple products. No doubt these are premium and costly devices but we get our money's worth over a long duration of t...

"So, after lot of searching and searching, finally, I purchased this Book4 I3 Variant.
Since, I have a galaxy S23, a tab S9FE Plus, a Galaxy watch 4 Classic, a Galaxy Buds, I had no other options rather that this Galaxy Book.
With all my stated products, everyone can now easily guess, I have everything on a Budget price.
As such, I had no other options rather than the I3 variant.

Coming to the laptop - the only difference is only the processor in all the Book4 and its the cheapest one.

The performance it delivers is just unmatched. On practical usage, it can easily beat the high-end Windows laptops. You are gonna love it from the moment you unbox it and would kinda wanna eat it once it falls in your hands.

The Apple silicon laptops really over-deliver than their on-paper specs. If it fits your budget...

"Been using it for the past two weeks, and here are my initial thoughts:

Pros:

1. I upgraded from i3 2nd gen, so the 12th gen is a major upgrade. I mainly have a few apps like Zotero, MS office, BlueStacks, and so far I have seen a minimal lag. Nothing major. So, the performance is good for day2day use.
